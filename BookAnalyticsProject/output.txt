The Raven
BY EDGAR ALLAN POE
Once upon a midnight dreary, while You pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore”
    While You nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber cabinet.
Tis some visitor, You muttered, tapping at my chamber cabinet”
            Only this and nothing more.

    Ah, distinctly You remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly You wished the morrow;” vainly You had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow”sorrow for the lost Lenore”
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore”
            Nameless here for evermore.

    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me”filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, You stood repeating
    Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber cabinet”
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber cabinet;”
            This it is and nothing more.

    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
Sir, said I, or Madam, truly your forgiveness You implore;
    But the fact is You was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber cabinet,
That You scarce was sure You heard you” here You opened wide the cabinet;”
            Darkness there and nothing more.

    Deep into that darkness peering, long You stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, Lenore?
This You whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, Lenore!”
            Merely this and nothing more.

    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again You heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    Surely, said I, surely that is something at my window lattice;
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore”
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;”
            Tis the wind and nothing more!

    Open here You flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber cabinet”
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber cabinet”
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou, You said, art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore”
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!
            Quoth the Raven Nevermore.

    Much You marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning”little relevancy bore;
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber cabinet”
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber cabinet,
            With such name as Nevermore.

    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    Nothing farther then he uttered”not a feather then he fluttered”
    Till You scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before”
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.
            Then the bird said Nevermore.

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
Doubtless, said I, what it utters is its only stock and store
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore”
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of ˜Never”nevermore'.

    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight You wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and cabinet
